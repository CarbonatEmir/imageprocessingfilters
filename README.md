Project Description
This project performs real-time analysis of video frames captured from your PC camera using Python and OpenCV. It demonstrates fundamental image processing techniques such as:

Sobel edge detection filter,

Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency analysis,

Integral image computation,

Morphological operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.

Additionally, the project includes visualization enhancements using color maps, logarithmic scaling, and alpha blending techniques.

Features
Capture and process live video from your camera

Apply Sobel filters for edge detection

Compute and visualize FFT magnitude spectrum in real time

Compute integral images and apply morphological filters

Example code to understand basic image processing concepts

Modular and easy to extend for further development

Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python)

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)
